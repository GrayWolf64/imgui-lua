# TODOs

1. `string.format()` %p get address
2. Remove the usage of `CArray` and `CValue` entirely. Use Lua native tables instead
3. All indices use 1 based!
4. All loop var start from 1 unless necessary
5. Project file structure. `include` & preprocessor usage.
    Use `getfenv` and `setfenv`?
6. *imgui_pp* pragma once, process_file with file.Write
7. Deal with GC? Optimize?
8. Exposed a lot of globals. Quite messy.
